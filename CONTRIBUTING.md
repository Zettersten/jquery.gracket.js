## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
feat: add support for double elimination brackets
fix: resolve canvas rendering issue on Safari
docs: update React examples in README
test: add tests for hover interactions
refactor: simplify bracket rendering logic
```

### TypeScript Styleguide

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Follow existing code style (enforced by ESLint)
* Use meaningful variable names
* Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
* Prefer const over let
* Use arrow functions where appropriate
* Avoid `any` types when possible

### Testing

* Write tests for all new features
* Maintain or improve code coverage
* Use descriptive test names
* Group related tests with `describe` blocks
* Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` for setup/teardown

Example:
```typescript
describe('Gracket', () => {
  describe('initialization', () => {
    it('should create bracket with provided data', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```
